About
-----
New Horizons Community Edition is a continuation of New Horizons by some dedicated fans of the mod. New Horizons was originally designed as a small project to help KillAshley get back into the game. The devs hope that more and more people will start actively playing it and hopefully revive the long-dormant community. The devs are attempting to do this by trying to bring the mod to somewhat current standards whilst keeping the core of the mod intact.

This pack completely rearranges the stock system and introduced 19 more bodies to visit and explore, along with compatibility and many features to improve gameplay.


Instructions
------------
Firstly, ensure any older version of NH and Kopernicus have been removed.

You will need to DELETE (important) the following folders when updating:
- GameData/Kopernicus
- Gamedata/New_Horizons

You will need to download it's dependency - Kopenicus. This is required to run the mod.
Just download the latest release, & and hotfixes available.

DO NOT install the Kopernicus Examples folder in the Kopernicus download.

Simply merge the downloaded .zip files into your KSP directory the same as with any other mod.
DO NOT EXTRACT THE .zip FILE STRAIGHT OUT - open it and merge the contents.
This should be all you are required to do for a basic install.

PLEASE REMEMBER TO BACKUP YOUR SAVEGAMES BEFORE INSTALLATION/UPDATING AS BUGS CAN & SOMETIMES DO OCCUR.

if you need to reset your ships landed on planets before/after updating, please use hyperedit as it makes resetting them simple and easy.

If you want to use some of the new features(Scatterer, AVP support, SigmaBinary support), put the files that you want from the Extras folder Directly into GameData


Optional Extras
---------------
New Horizons aims to expand and overhaul the entire solar system, and as such there are a few optional extras not included in the main release that could significantly improve your gameplay.

Custom scatterer configs
- Adds scatterer configs to atmospheric bodies so that they look that little bit better.
	
Astronomer's Visual Pack Support
- Adds AVP visuals to New Horizons(Not yet in as of writing this, close to done)
	
Community Resource Pack Compatibility
- Adds support for custom resources for mods such as the USI catalogue, Extra-Planetary Launchpads & many more.(Not yet implemented)
